# Hi, Iâ€™m Keegan. Nice to meet you.
I started my journey to become a software engineer over a decade ago. I've done remote work for freelance clients and startups, all while collaborating with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on learning anything and everything about computers.
